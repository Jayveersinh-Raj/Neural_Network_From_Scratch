In this notebook, neural network from scratch was implemented using numpy on the open source database of digit recognition
1. 1 hidden layer with 10 neurons
2. 784 input neurons (each for 1 pixel, 28x28 image is used)
3. 1 output layer with 10 neurons representing 0-9 numbers
4. All output numbers are One-Hot encoded
5. Optimizer implemented -> Gradient Descent
6. Activations -> 1. ReLU for the 1st synapse, 2. Softmax for the other
